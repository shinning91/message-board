# Message board with Django and ReactJS

## How to run

`cd` into `postboard` folder to run Django backend.
Run `./manage.py runserver`
Open `localhost:8000`

`cd` into `postboard-fe` folder to run React app.
Run `npm start` to run the app
Open `localhost:3000`

**Note**: Run Django backend app first as the React app will call an API to Django server to get latest posts.
